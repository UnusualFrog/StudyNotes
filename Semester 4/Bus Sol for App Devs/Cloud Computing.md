## Types of Cloud Computing
- Cloud computing is providing developers and IT departments with the ability to focus on what matters most and avoid undifferentiated work like procurement, maintenance, and capacity planning.
- As cloud computing has grown in popularity, several different models and deployment strategies have emerged to help meet specific needs of different users.
- Each Type of cloud service and deployment method provides you with different levels of control, flexibility and management.
- Understanding the differences between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, as well as what deployment strategies you can use, can help you decide what set of services is right for your needs.

## Infrastructure as a Service (**IaaS**)
- Infrastructure as a Service contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide access to networking features, computers (virtual or dedicated hardware), data and storage space
- IaaS provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments are familiar with today.
- *Ex. AWS, Microsoft Azure*
## Platform as a Service (**PaaS**)
- PaaS removes the need for organizations to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and OSes) and allow you to focus on deployment and management of your applications.
- *Ex. Salesforce, Heroku*

## Software as a Service (**SaaS**)
- SaaS provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider.
- In most cases people referring to SaaS are referring to end-user applications.
- With SaaS offerings you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is manage
- Only need to think about how you will use that particular piece of software
- A common example of SaaS is web-based email where you can send and receive email without having to manage feature additions to email the product or maintaining the servers and operating system that the email program is running on
- *EX. TXTSquad, Gmail, Spotify*
