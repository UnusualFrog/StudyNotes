## Formal Process
- Failures occur often
- Making a system is not intuitive
- Projects end up either late, over budget or with missing features

## System Analyst
- Designs a system to add value
- Understands the business processes
- Rewarding but challenging
- Requires specific skill set

## Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- 4 phases
- Each phase has steps
- Each phase is documented (deliverables)
- Phases executed sequentially, incrementally, iteratively or in other pattern

## Questions TBA for each phase

### Planning Phase
- Why build the system
- What value will it provide
- How long will it take to build

### Analysis
- Who will use it
- What should the system do for us
- Where and when will it be used

### Design
- How should we build it
## SDLC: Planning Phase
### 1. Project Initiation
- Develop/Receive a system request
- Conduct a feasibility analysis

### 2. Project Management
- Develop the work plan
- Staff the project
- Monitor & control the project


## SDLC: The Analysis Phase
### 1. Develop an analysis strategy
- Model current system
- Formulate the new system

### 2. Gather Requirements
- Develop a system concept
- Create a business model to represent:
	- Business data
	- Business processes

### 3. Develop a system proposal

## SDLC: The Design Phase
1. Develop a design strategy
2. Develop architecture and interfaces
3. Develop databases and file specifications
4. Develop the program design to specify:
	- What programs to write
	- What each program will do

## SDLC: The Implementation Phase
### 1. Construct the system
-  Build it (write the code)
- Test it

### 2. Install the system
- Train the users

### 3. Support the system (maintenance)

## SDLC: Methodologies 
- Methodology: A formalized approach to implementing the SDLC
-  Categories:
	- Process oriented
	- Data centered
	- Object-oriented
	- Structured
	- Rapid action development (RAD)
	- Agile development

## Classes of Methodologies 
### Structured Development
- Waterfall
- Parallel

### Rapid Application Development
- Phased
- Prototyping

### Agile Development
- eXtreme programming
- SCRUM

## The System Analyst: Skills
### Agents of change
- Identify ways to improve the organization
- Motivate & train others
### Skills needed
- Technical: must understand the technology
- Business: must know the business processes
- Analytical: must be able to problem solve
- Communications: technical & non-technical
- Interpersonal: leadership & management
- Ethics: deal fairly and protect confidential information

## The Systems Analyst: Roles
### Business Analyst
- Focuses on business issues

### Systems Analyst
- Focuses on information systems issues

### Infrastructure Analyst
- Focuses on the technical issues

### Change Management Analyst
- Focuses o the people and management issues

### Project Manager
- Ensures that the project is completed on time and within budget

## Object-Oriented Systems Analysis & Design
- Attempts to balance data and processes
- Utilizes UML and the unified process
- Characteristics of OOSAD:
	- Use-Case driven
	- Architecture centric
	- Iterative & Incremental

## Characteristics of Object-Oriented Systems
### Classes & Objects
- Object: instance of class
- Attributes: information describing the class
- State: Describes values and relationships at a point in time

### Methods  & Messages
- Methods: the behavior of classes
- Messages: information sent to an object to trigger a method (procedure call)

### Encapsulation & Information Hiding
- Encapsulation: Combination of process & data
- Information hiding: functionality is hidden

### Inheritance
- General classes are create (superclasses)
- Subclasses inherit data from a superclass

### Polymorphism
- Polymorphism: the same message can have different meanings
- Dynamic binding: type of object is not determined until runtime
- Contrast with static binding

## Object-Oriented Systems Analysis & Design
### Use-Case Driven:
- Use-cases define behavior of a system
- Each use-case focuses on one business process

### Architecture Centric
- Functional (external) view: Focuses on user perspective
- Static (structural) view: Focuses on attributes, methods, classes & relationships
- Dynamic (behavioral) view: Focuses on messages between classes resulting in behaviors

### Iterative & Incremental
- Undergoes continuous testing & refinement
- The analyst understands the system better over time

### Benefits of OOSAD
- Break a complex system into smaller, more manageable modules
- Work on modules individually

## The Unified Process
- Specific methodology that maps how and when to use UML techniques for Object-Oriented analysis and design
- A 2D process consisting of phases and workflows
	- Phases are time periods in development
	- Workflows are the tasks that occur in each phase
	- Activities in both phases & workflows overlap

## Unified Process Phases
### Inception
- Feasibility analyses performed
- Workflows vary but focus is on business modeling and requirement gathering

### Elaboration
- Heavy focus on analysis and design
- Other workflows may be included

### Construction
- Focus on programming (implementation)

### Transition
- Focus on testing & deployment

## Engineering Workflows
- Business modeling
- Requirements
- Analysis
- Design
- Implementation
- Testing
- Deployment

## Supporting Workflows
- Project management
- Configuration and change management
- Environment
- Operations and support (enhanced unified process)
- Infrastructure management (enhanced unified process)

## Extension to the Unified Process
### The Unified Process does not include:
- Staffing
- Budgeting
- Contract Management
- Maintenance
- Operations
- Support
- Cross/Inter project issues

### Add a Production Phase to address issues after deployment

### New workflows
- Operations & Support
- Infrastructure management

### Modifications to Existing Workflows
- Test workflow
- Deployment workflow
- Environment workflow
- Project management workflow
- Configuration & change management workflow

## Unified Modeling Language
- Provides a common vocabulary of object-oriented terms and techniques rich enough to model any system development project from analysis through implementation

### Version 2.5 has 15 diagrams in 2 major groups
- Structure diagrams
- Behavior diagrams

## UML Structure Diagrams
### Represent the data and static relationships in an information system
- Class
- Object
- Package
- Deployment
- Component
- Composite Structure

## UML Behavior Diagrams
### Depict the dynamic relationships among the instances or objects that represent the business system
- Activity 
- Sequence
- Communication
- Interaction overview
- Timing
- Behavior state machine
- Protocol state machine
- Use-case diagrams

## Summary
- All systems development projects follow essentially the same process called the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- Systems development methodologies are formalized approaches to implementing SDLCs
- The systems analyst need a variety of skills and plays many different roles
- Object-oriented systems differ from traditional systems
- Object-Oriented Systems Analysis and Design (OOSAD) uses a use-case driven, architecture centric, iterative and incremental information systems development approach  
- The Unified Process is a 2D systems development process described with a set of phases and workflows
- The Unified Modeling Language, or UML is a standard set of diagramming techniques
