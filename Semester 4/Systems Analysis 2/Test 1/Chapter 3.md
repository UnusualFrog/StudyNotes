## Introduction
- The systems development process transforms the existing (as-is) system into the proposed (to-be) system
### Requirements Determination
- Single most critical step of the entire SDLC
- Changes can be made easily in this stage
- Most (>50%) system failures are due to problems with requirements
- The iterative process of OOSAD is effective because:
	- Small batches of requirements can be identified and implemented incrementally
	- The system will evolve over time

## Requirements Determination
- Purpose: to convert high level business requirements (from the system request) into detailed requirements that can be used as inputs for creating models
- What is a requirement?
	- A statement of what the system must do or a characteristic it must have
	- Will later evolve into a technical description of how the system will be implemented
- Types:
	- Functional: relates to a process or data
	- Non-Functional: relates to performance or usability

## Requirements Definition
- Functional & non-functional requirements listed in outline format
- May be prioritized
- Provides information needed in subsequent workflows
- Defines the scope of the system

## Determining Requirements
- Business & IT personnel need to collaborate
- Strategies for problem analysis
	- Root cause analysis
	- Duration analysis
	- Activity-based costing
	- Informal benchmarking 
	- Outcome analysis
	- Technology analysis
	- Activity elimination
- Requirements are nest determined by systems analysts **and** business people together
- Techniques for identifying requirements
	- Interviews, questionnaires and/or observation
	- Joint application development (JAD)
	- Document analysis

## Creating a Requirements Definition
- Determine the types of functional and non-functional requirements applicable to the project
- Use requirements-gathering techniques to collect details
- Analysts work with users to verify, change and prioritize each requirement
- Continue this process through analysis workflow, but be careful of scope creep
- Requirements that meet a need but are not within current scope can be added to a list of future enhancements

## Problems in Requirements Determination
- Analyst may not have access to the correct users
- Requirements specifications may be inadequate
- Some requirements may not be known in the beginning
- Verifying and validating requirements can be difficult

## Requirements Analysis Strategies
### Problem Analysis
- Ask users to identify problems with the current system
- Ask users how they would solve these problems
- Good for improving efficiency or ease-of-use

### Root Cause Analysis
- Focus is on the cause of a problem, not its solution
- Create a prioritized list of problems
- Try to determine their causes
- Once the causes are known, solutions can be developed

### Duration Analysis
- Determine the time required to complete each step in a business process
- Compare this to the total time required for the entire process
- Large differences suggest problems that might be solved by:
	- Integrating some steps together
	- Performing some steps simultaneously (in parallel)
### Activity-Based Costing
- Same as duration analysis but applied to costs
### Informal benchmarking
- Analyzes similar processes in other successful organizations
### Outcome Analysis
- What does the customer want in the end?
### Technology Analysis
- Apply new technologies to business processes & identify benefits
### Activity Elimination
- Eliminate each activity in a business process in a "force-fit" exercise

## Requirements Gathering Techniques
- Process is used to:
	- Uncover all requirements (those uncovered late are difficult to incorporate)
	- Build support and trust among users
- Which technique to use?
	- Interviews
	- Joint Application Development (JAD)
	- Questionnaires
	- Document analysis
	- Document analysis
	- Observation

## Interviews
- Most popular technique - if you need to know something just ask
- Process
	- Select people to interview and make schedule
	- Design interview questions (Open-ended, close ended, probing)
	- Prepare for the interview (structured vs. unstructured in logical order)
	- Conduct the interview (top down vs. bottom up)
	- Follow-up after the interview
- Post Interview
	- Prepare notes and send to the interviewee for verification

## Joint Application Development (JAD)
- Joint user-analyst meeting hosted by a facilitator
	- 10 to 20 users
	- 1 to 2 scribes as needed to record session
	- Usually in a specially prepared room
- Meetings can be held electronically and anonymously
	- Reduces problems in group settings
	- Can be held remotely
- Sessions require careful planning to be successful 
	- Users may need to bring documents or user manuals
	- Ground rules should be established

## Questionnaires
- A set if written questions used to obtain information from individuals
- May be paper or electronic
- Common uses:
	- Large number of people
	- Need both information and opinions
	- When designing for use outside the organization (customers, vendors, etc.)
- Typical response rates <50% (paper); <30% (Web)

## Questionnaire Steps
- Select participants
	- Identify population
	- Use representative samples for large populations
- Designing the questionnaire
	- Careful question selection
	- Remove ambiguities
- Administering the questionnaire
	- Working to get good response rate
	- Offer incentive (free pen)
- Questionnaire follow-up
	- Send results to participants
	- Send a thank-you

## Good Questionnaire Design
- Begin with non-threatening and interesting questions
- Group items into logically coherent sections
- No important items at the very end
- Do not crowd a page with too many items
- Avoid abbreviations
- Avoid biased or suggestive items or terms
- Number questions to avoid confusion
- Pre-test to identify confusing questions
- Provide anonymity to respondents

## Document Analysis
- Provides information about the "as-is" system
- Review technical documents when available
- Review typical user documents:
	- Forms
	- Reports
	- Policy Manuals
- Look for user additions to forms
- Look for unused elements

## Observation
- Users/managers often don't remember everything they do
- Checks validity of information gathered in other ways
- Behaviors may change when people are watched
	- Workers tend to be very careful when watched
	- Keep a low profile
	- Try not to interrupt or influence workers
- Be careful not to ignore periodic activities
	- Weekly/Monthly/Annually

## Requirements-Gathering Techniques Compared
- A combination of techniques may be used
- Document analysis & observation require little training; JAD sessions can be challenging

## Alternative Techniques
- Concept Maps
	- Represent meaningful relationships between concepts
	- Focus on individuals on a small number of key ideas
- User Stories, Story Cards, & Task Lists
	- Associated with agile development
	- Very low tech, high touch, easily updatable, very portable
	- Captured using story cards (index cards)
	- Captured both functional and nonfunctional requirements

## Story Cards & Task Lists
- Capture requirements using story cards
- File card with single requirement
- Each requirement card is discussed
	- How much effort to implement
	- A task list created for each requirement
	- Large requirements can be split into several smaller ones
	- The story can be prioritized by risk level and importance

## The System Proposal
- Combines all material created in planning and analysis
- Includes sections:
	- Executive summary
		- Provides all critical information in summary form
		- Helps busy executives determine which sections to read in detail
	- The system request
	- The workplan
	- The feasibility analysis
	- The requirements definition
	- Current models of the system (expected to evolve)
