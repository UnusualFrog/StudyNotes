## Project Selection
- Projects must be approved by management before they proceed further
- Approval process may be formal or informal
- Projects in approval have already been deemed "valid"
- Project selection technique are used to select the most appropriate project to do from a list of "valid" ones
- Several selection techniques, such as:
	- Decision Models
	- Expert Judgement

## Project Selection – Decision Models
- Decision models are formal methodologies that help in making decisions regarding budgets, resources, etc.
- Decision models attempt to provide decision makers with objective comparisons of projects so they can be prioritized and the best decision can be made about which project to do.
- Categories of decision models include:
	- Benefit measurement methods
	- Constrained-optimization models

### Benefit Measurement Methods
- Benefit measurement methods allow you to compare the benefits of different projects
- Benefit measurement methods include: 
	- Cost-benefit analysis (CBA)
	- Scoring model
	- Payback period
	- Economic Model
- None of these methods are necessarily complete by itself, for example, CBA doesn't consider a project's strategic importance
- Often multiple methods are used 

#### Cost Benefit Analysis
- Compares the cost to produce the result to the financial benefits that the result will bring
- The "result" refers to the output the project will produce (I.E. new system, product or service)
- Effective way to look at the financial aspect but does not consider other important factors

#### Scoring Model
- List of criteria with weights assigned to each criteria and a rating for each criteria for each project
- For each project, each criteria score is calculated and totaled and the project with the highest score would be considered best
- List of criteria can be extensive and include financial as well as non-financial factors making this a comprehensive method
- Only effective if valid criteria, weights and ratings are developed, which requires extensive work and collaboration among users, management etc.

#### Payback Period
- Identified the length of time it takes for an organization to recover costs of the project

#### Economic Model
- Series of financial calculations which provide information on the overall financial aspects of the project
- Common economic model calculations include:
	- Discounted cash flow - Compares the value of the future worth of expected cash flows to today's dollar
	- Net present value - Calculates the revenues/cash flows over the life of the project in today's dollar
	- Internal rate of return - States the profitability of an investment (the project) as an average percent over the life of the investment (the project)

- Often payback periods and the economic model calculations mentioned prior, are all completed as part of a CBA

#### Constrained-Optimization Model
- Complex mathematical models (not covered in this course)

## Project Selection – Expert Judgment
- Relies on the expertise of stakeholders, management, subject-matter experts, etc. to help make decisions regarding project selection
- Should be objective but may not necessarily be so
- Ex. If Management is involved, a particular manager may have undue influence over selection
- Once the process is complete and a project is selected, a project manage will be assigned to each project and the project mangement process will start as the project proceeds
