## Introduction
- Project management is the process of planning and controlling system development within a specified time at a minimum cost with the right functionality
- A project is a set of activities with a specified beginning and end point meant to create a system that brings value to the business
- Project Managers monitor and control all tasks and roles that need to be coordinated
- Inception Phase: Generate a system request based on a business need or opportunity
- Perform a feasibility analysis; revise the system request
- Approve or decline the project

## Project Identification
### Projects are driven by business needs
- Identified by business people
- Identified by IT people
- (best) Identified by both

### The Project Sponsor believes in the system and want it to succeed
- Normally this is a business person
- Should have the authority to move it forward

## Business Value
### Tangible Value
- Can be quantified and measured directly
- EX. 2% reduction in operating costs

### Intangible Value
- We know it will add value & save time, but we may not be able to quantify or measure its benefits
- EX. Improved customer services

## The System Request
- A document describing the reasons for and the value added from building a new system
- Contains 5 elements: 
	- Project Sponsor: Primary point of contact for the project
	- Business need: Reason prompting the project
	- Business Requirements: what will the system do
	- Business Value: How will the organization benefit from the project
	- Special Issues: Anything else to be considered

## Feasibility Analysis
### Is the project feasible
- What are the risks
- Can the risks be overcome

### Major components
- Technical Feasibility (Can we build it)
- Economic Feasibility (Should we build it)
- Organizational Feasibility (Will they use it)

## Technical Feasibility
### Identify risks in the following areas
- Functional area: Are analysts familiar with this portion of the business
- The Technology: Less familiarity generates more risk
- Project size: Large projects have more risk
- Compatibility: Difficult integration increases the risk

## Economic Feasibility (Cost-Benefit Analysis)
- Identify the costs and the benefits
- Assign values to each
- Determine cash flow
- Determine the value using one or more methods:
	- Net present value (NPV)
	- Return on investment (ROI)
	- Break-even point

## Organization Feasibility
- Will users accept the system
- Is the project strategically aligned with the business
- Conduct a stakeholder analysis
	- Project Champion(s)
	- Organizational management
	- System users
	- Others

## Project Selection
- Projects are approved, declined or delayed based on value added vs. risks

- Project portfolio management
	- Goals
		- Maximize cost/benefit ratio
		- Maintain an optimal mix of projects based on:
			- Risk
			- Size, cost and length of time to complete
			- Purpose, scope & business value
		- Limited resource trade-offs
		
-  Selected projects enter the management process

## Project Management Tools
- Aids in creating work plans
- Identify all tasks, their sequence and estimate the time to complete each one
- Work breakdown structure (WBS): Hierarchy of tasks to identify:
	- Duration of each task
	- Current status of each task
	- Task dependencies (Shows which tasks must be completed before others can start)
- Gnatt Charts: Horizontal bar chart that shows the WBS graphically
- Network diagrams: PERT and CPM

## Project Effort Estimation
- Estimation involves trade-offs between functionality, time and cost
- It is the process of assigning projected values for tine and effort
- Most accurate estimates come from experience
- Use-case point method; based on:
	- Technical complexity factors (13)
	- Environmental factors (8)

## Creating & Managing the Work Plan
- Work Plan: A dynamic and sequential list of all tasks needed to complete a project

- Approaches:
	- Modify existing or completed projects
	- Derive the tasks from the methodology being used

- Unified Processes:
	- Iterative & Incremental
	- Workplan is also iterative & incremental
		- Tasks and time intervals follow the phases
		- Different task executed for each workflow

## Evolutionary Work Breakdown Structures
- Organized in a standard manner across all projects
- Created in an iterative & incremental manner
- Generality supports learning from past mistakes and successes

- Unified Processes:
	- Workflows are the major divisions
	- Workflows are decomposed along the phases
	- Phases are decomposed along the required tasks
	- Tasks are added as each iteration is completed

## Scope Management
### Scope Creep
- Occurs after the project is underway
- Results from adding the requirements to the project
- Can have deleterious effect on the schedule

### Techniques to Manage the Project Scope:
- Identify all requirements at the outset
- Allow only those changes deemed absolutely necessary
- Carefully examine the impact of suggested changes
- Delay some changes for "future enhancements"
- Time boxing

## Staffing the Project
### Goals:
- Determining how many people are require
- Match the skill sets to required activities
- Motivate the team to meet the objectives
- Minimize conflicts

### Deliverables - The Staffing Plan, which includes:
- Number & kind of people assigned
- Overall reporting structure
- The project charter (describes project objectives and rules)

## Creating a "Jelled" Team
- A team of people so strongly knit that the whole is greater than the sum of parts
- Characteristics of a jelled team:
	- Low turnover rate
	- Strong sense of identity
	- A feeling of eliteness
	- Team vs. individual ownership of project
	- Team members enjoy their work

## Staffing Plan
- Calculate the number of people needed:
	 `number of people = person-months/ time to complete (months)`
- Lines of communication increase exponentially as people are added to a project
- Create a reporting structure for projects with large numbers of people assigned
- Form sub-teams as necessary
- Assign the Project Manager, Functional Lead & Technical Lead
- Pay attention to technical and interpersonal skills

## Motivating People
- Motivation is the greatest influence on performance
- Monetary reward usually do not motivate
- Suggested motivating technique:
	- 20% time rule
	- Peer-to-peer recognition awards
	- Team ownership (refer to the team as "we")
	- Allow members to focus of what interests them
	- Utilize equitable compensation
	- Encourage group ownership
	- Provide for autonomy, but trust the team to deliver

## Handling Conflict
### Preventing or Mitigating Conflict:
- Cohesiveness has the greatest effect
- Clearly defining roles and holding team members accountable
- Establish work & communications rules in the project charter

### Additional Techniques
- Clearly define plans for the project
- Make sure the team understands the importance of the project
- Develop detailed operating procedures
- Develop a project charter
- Develop a schedule of commitments in advanced
- Forecast other priorities and their impact on the project

## Environmental & Infrastructure Management
### Environment - Chose the Right Set of Tools
- Use appropriate CASE tools to:
	- Increase productivity and centralize information (repository)
	- Utilize diagrams - more easily understood
- Establish standards to reduce complexity 

### Infrastructure - Document the Project Appropriately 
- Store deliverables & communications in a project binder
- Use Unified Process standard documents
- Don't put off documentation to the last minute
