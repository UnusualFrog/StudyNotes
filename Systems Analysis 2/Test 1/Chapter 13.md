## Introduction
- Managing the change to a new system is one of the most difficult tasks in any organization
- Conversion planning normally begins while the programmers are still coding
- Change management focuses on people
- Maintenance can account for 60-80% of IS budget

## A Model for Implementing Change
![[ImplementingChangeModel.png]]

## Cultural Issues and Information Technology
- Factors that may affect adoption/acceptance of technology
	- Speed of messages - may affect documentation & training
	- Context: high context societies need to see how the new system fits in to existing systems
	- Time: polychronic vs. monochronic (similar to parallel vs. serial)
	- Power distance - can a subordinate point out errors?
	- Uncertainty avoidance - related to risk and stress caused by change
	- Individualism vs. Collectivism - who is more important: the individual or the group?
	- Masculinity vs. femininity
	- Long vs. short-term orientation - which is the focus: long term relationships or short term profits?

## Conversion
- Conversion is the technical process by which a new system replaces an old system
- Three major steps to a conversion plan
	- Buy & install hardware
	- Install new software
	- Convert data
- Conversion dimensions
	- Conversion style - direct or parallel
	- Conversion location - pilot, phased or simultaneous
	- Conversion modules - whole system at once or one module at a time

## Elements of Migration Plan

## Selecting Conversion Strategies
- Combine dimensions to form a strategy as needed
	- Example: Begin with a pilot conversion using parallel conversion in a a handful of locations, once successful, roll out to remaining locations using phased conversion
- Prioritize risk, cost, and time

## Change Management
- The process of helping people adopt & adapt to-be system and its accompanying work processes without undue stress
- Key roles
	- Sponsor
	- Change agent
	- Potential adopters
- "Built it and they will come" doesn't work

## Resistance to Change
- What is good for the organization is often not good for the people in it
- People perform their own personal cost-benefit analysis
	- Perceived cost & benefits are weighted by the amount of uncertainty associated with them
	- Most will overestimate costs and underestimate benefits
	- Must take into account the transition process cost
	- Perceived costs and benefits are more important than real costs and benefit

## Costs & Benefits of Change

## Revising Management Policies
- Management policies
	- Provide goals
	- Define how work processes should be performed
	- Determine how people are rewarded
- No computer system will be successfully adopted unless management policies support its adoption

## Work Process Structuring Tools
- Standard Operating Procedures
	- SOPs must be revised to match the to-be system
- Measurement and rewards
	- Design to motivate desired (acceptance) behavior
- Resource Allocation
	- Direct effect is the actual reallocation of resources
	- Symbolic effect shows that management is serious about the new system

## Assessing Costs & Benefits
- Develop a list of costs & benefits from two perspectives:
	- The Organization
	- The The Potential Adopters
- Consider the effects on both end-users and managers
- Goal is to persuade those who might resist to support the change 
	- Significant management changes may be required to prevent grassroots derailing efforts
- A successful organization may find it harder to manage change
	- People need to be convinced that what has worked in the past may not work in the future

## Motivating Adoption
- Provide clear and convincing evidence of the need for change
- Two basic strategies to motivate adoption
	- Informational strategy
	- Political strategy
- Change management goal is to support and encourage the ready adopters and help them win over the reluctant adopters

## Enabling Adoption: Training
- Provide the skills needed to adopt the change
	- Don't assume the system is so simple to learn that new users need no training
- What to train?
	- Don't focus on using the system
	- Focus on helping the users accomplish their jobs
	- Focus on what the user needs to do, not what the system is capable of doing
- How to train?
	- In groups in a classroom
	- 1 on 1
	- Computer based training (***CBT***)

## Selecting Training Methods

## Post-implementation Activities
- Goal is to institutionalize the new system
	- Make it the normal and accepted routine
	- "Refreeze" the organization after successful transition
- Usually the job of the project sponsor and manager
	- Actively promote its use and monitor its adoption
	- Provide steady flow of information to users to encourage use

## System Support
- Now transition from project team to an operations group
	- Responsible for operating the system & providing system support
- Types of system support
	- On-demand training
	- Online support (e.g. documentation & FAQs)
	- Help desk to provide expert advice
		- Level 1 support should satisfy 80% of problems
		- Unable to solve at level 1:
			- Generate problem report or ticket
			- Escalate to Level 2

## Elements of a Problem Report

## System Maintenance
- The process of refining the system to make sure it continues to meet business needs
- More expensive than initial development
- Novice system analysts & programmers will work on maintenance projects
- Change requests are smaller versions of a system request
- Requests may come from a number of different sources
	- Problem reports
	- Users
	- Other projects
	- Underlying software (e.g., OS changes)
	- Senior management

## Processing a Change Request

## Project Assessment
- Determine what was successful and what needs to be improved
	- Project Team Review
		- Members list what worked and mistakes that were made
		- Goal is to repeat excellent performance and eliminate mistakes
		- Project manager can prepare a "lessons learned" document
	- System Review
		- To what extent the proposed costs & benefits actually accrue
		- Goal is to compare estimates with actual values
			- Determine whether or not the system provides the expected value
			- Provide baseline costs for future projects
